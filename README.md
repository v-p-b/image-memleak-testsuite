Image Memory Disclosure Test Suite
==================================

Malformed test images to detect uninitialized memory disclosure. 

Samples are created so they contain "blank" color information to facilitate automated detection of memory disclosure. For more information see my paper: [Uninitialized Memory Dislosures in Web Applications](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/webappsec/uninitialized-memory-disclosures-web-applications-39460).
